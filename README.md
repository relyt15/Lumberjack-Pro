Lumberjack Pro is a forest themed project and task manager. Aimed at taking larger projects and breaking them down into smaller items in a to-do list, Lumberjack Pro can help organize and achieve your goals.

It will be useful for managing work, class assignments, chores, hobbies, and other projects. This will be done by having a single place to look at all of the progress on any project someone is working on in any scenario.

The design and concept of the program is collabrative.

Tyler -Handled dialog boxes for creating and editing tasks/projects, added editing functionality, made the arrays that are used to keep track of the projects and tasks, and created the add Project and add Task Buttons.

Neo - Designed the UI, added scroll panes, created the calendar due-date selection, added delete functions, and created the completed task/project checkbox.

Alex -Created the first iteration of the user-defined project and task information, helped create the completed task/project checkboxes.
