# Lumberjack-Pro
Task and/or Project manager
Project Name: Lumberjack Pro
Team name: Timbermen
Team members: **Tyler Conway**, **Neo Hang**, **Alex Matovski**

- We will be building a task and projet manager. We want to build it because we want to have better organization of everyday chores and homework as students.
It will be useful by managing work, class assignments, chores, hobbies, and other projects. This will be done by having a single place to look at all of the progress on any project someone is working on in any scenario.

The design and concept of the program will be collabrative.
- Neo - Interface design, back-end, class and method development
- Alex - Front-end and back-end, class and method development
- Tyler - Backend, front-end, class and method development
